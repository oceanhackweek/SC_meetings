## 2022/11/09 Steering Committee meeting

**Chair:** Alex **Scribe:** Cath

**Attendees:** Alex, Derya, Sophie, Filipe, Cath, Emilio

**Decisions made:**

- It's time to start gathering folks to be the organizing committee for next years event.
  - We are aiming to have an event more similar to 2021 with a little 2022 in there. That is to have a primary in-person event, and then a global virtual event based around the in-person time, with a few satellites. The aim is to have participants evenly distributed between the main in-person event, fully virtual, and the satellites. Satellites aren't expected to be as integrated as we attempted to make happen this year.
- We're going to make a expression of intent for the UN Ocean Decade.
- Finishing up 1 pager application for NSF CyberTraining
- We're going to investigate CRM (customer/contact relationship management) tools.
  - OHW is starting to get big enough and has now gone on for long enough that trying to remember who-knows-whom is starting to be a handicap. We're going to explore what CRMs are out there, so we can ask questions like 'who's been involved and expressed interest in helping to organize OHW?' (see the first decision)
