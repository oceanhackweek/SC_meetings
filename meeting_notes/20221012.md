**Decisions made**

- Charter will be made public by the end of the month.
- NSF Cybertraining will have a meeting on 10/14 to discuss the details of forming a proposal, and any documents that need to be produced pre-proposal deadline.
- The current Steering Committee will continue as the Steering Committee until the end of the year, and affirmations or declines will be made then.
- Consideration of changing the post-event survey in favor of adopting parts of a survey used by hack event researchers was agreed upon and put off in favor of dealing with proposals, other more pressing issues.
- We should search out more information on pedagogy and see how we can apply knowledge from that field to improve OHW.
- Certificates are very useful for participants, especially non-US participants with regards to reimbursements, and we Wu-Jung is following up on making sure certificates are being sent out.
- A "spin-off" of OHW, based on a Spanish grant with a super majority of OHW attendees, is happening. The Steering Committee will consider how much much help/affiliation we can give to them.
