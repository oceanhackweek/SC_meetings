## 2022/09/07 Steering committee meeting

**Chair**: Wu-Jung Lee   **Scribe**: Joseph Gum

**Attendees**: Nick Mortimer, Cath Mitchell, Derya Gumustel, Joseph Gum, Emilio Mayorga, Wu-Jung Lee

**Decisions made**
- Open meeting notes
  - We will post a meeting summary after each steering committee (SC) meeting right now
  - We will revisit the details of open meeting notes once we wrap up the current more frequent (weekly) meeting schedule in order to settle down the SC structures and fall back into a more stabilized, longer-interval (monthly) schedule
- SC meeting chairing
  - We decided to continue rotating the SC chairing responsibilities as we have done since the beginning of 2022
  - We clarified that the chair of the SC meeting is different from the chair of the organizer meeting for the OHW event that year; the chair of the OHW organizer meeting will be a single person who oversees the entire event organization
- SC charter
  - We reviewed the SC charter draft and made a handful of decisions, and will continue discussing the remaining questions in the next SC meetings
